## Project Summary

This cookbookâ€™s recipe collection gives a comprehensive presentation of the recipes of various dishes, as well as the ingredients needed and the steps to make them. In addition to the most basic query functions, our application also has functions for users to rate, upload their own recipes and delete their own recipes. And we also show the existing recipes in the user's home page. In order to manage a large number of recipes, we designed an manager interface, where the manager can login to the manager interface by using a special username. Here, the manager can review the newly uploaded recipes and the manager has the permission to delete any recipe.
